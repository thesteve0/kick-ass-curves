Devrelcon talk

1. Why I am giving talk- help us with the goal of making our users excited and succesful on our product/platform
2. Models - all of them wrong, some of them are useful. MOdels are a tool 
3. Kathy Sierra and the wonderful too/model she has given us - the kick ass curve
4. Show the curve with it labeled - redraw using different colors - explain the curve
5, Explain some basic things we can derive from the curve - like why doc and introductory material are so important
6. Now we can understand why we need diversity in learning material. People start with different points on the curve for understanding your project/product
7. Who do PMs spend all their time talking to  and where are they on the curve- Where do we spend a lot of our time - This is why we don't always see eye to eye in terms of priority
8 Where do most of our engineers live - maybe this is why it's harder to get most of the excited about ease of use
9. Kathy's curve only shows us a green field experience. Let's look at why our job becomes harder when another product is already being used by the developer
10. Take home from the curve
	THink about who your audience is and how to get them past the suck zone ASAP
	If we can't get people out of the suck zone before they give up  - we will never get them to experience the power
	Remember when talking to others to think about where they are on the curve 
	Use the curve when it helps, ignore it when it is doesn't.
